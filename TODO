MILESTONE #1 - "move units here" campaign
 - should attack entities (auto-morph/unmorph) actually live on the occupancy grid? or should they transcend it?
 - change gatherer/collector to keep track of which resource is held/deposited
 - change mouse hover to show if something is targetable/attackable

 - create map editor

 - rubygoo integration
   - create buttons w/ images
   - create attack/move buttons
   - create Element class to parent Button,Checkbox,StoryStack

 - create ability panel in gui to display currently available abilities

 - clean up and add docs EVERYWHERE
 - add images to story stacks, with ken burns effect (pan/zoom)

MILESTONE #2 - "gameplay"
 - add structures (basic unit creation) (larger than one tile)
 - add structure placement "grid-locking"

MULTIPLAYER MILESTONE #3
 - add simple intro UI (map selection)
 - how to fire off external server for multiplayer? (separate ruby call?  ruby server.rb? )

PROBLEMS
 - dragging settings window crashes
 - dragging on minimap shouldn't show selection box
 - every movable entity should have its own Pathfinder (where should it get it?)
   - or the same Pathfinder that we can pass in something to lookup map/unit occupancy

BACKLOG
 - add logger to app

MILESTONE #1 - "move units here" campaign
 - change gatherer/collector to keep track of which resource is held/deposited
 - change mouse hover to show if something is targetable/attackable
 - change components to register handlers (in order) for abilities so entity_manager doesn't know about them.
   - EM will just say "this ent was told to do something to this target"; keeping EM dumb
   - add abilities to units (maybe not needed for this milestone)
     - rework able component?

 - change map_script triggers to register for occupancy_grid changes
 - change campaign execution to goto next map in the campaign
 - create map editor

 - rubygoo integration
   - create buttons w/ images
   - create attack/move buttons
   - create Element class to parent Button,Checkbox,StoryStack

 - create ability panel in gui to display currently available abilities

 - clean up and add docs EVERYWHERE
 - add images to story stacks, with ken burns effect (pan/zoom)
